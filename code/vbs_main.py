Running each part will deal with the different steps from stimuli creation to
the final analyses and plots

Steps:
    - import of necessary functions
    - creation of stimuli (if not already present)
    - creation of datasets for letters and words
    - presentation of letter stimuli to untrained alexnets
    - replication of VBE
    - analyses of VBE
    - plots of VBE
    - replications of VBT
    - analyses of VBT
    - plots of VBT
